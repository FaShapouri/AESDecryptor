# AESDecryptor

AESDecryptor decrypt based on AES algorithm , it provides two mode of decryption, CBC and ECB modes. Current code allows 128 bits and 265 bits encryptions.

The encrypted data fetch by url of a text file.

Sample text files provided at repository. secret key of this files are:

128 Bits: `0p9o8i7u6y5t4r3e`
256 Bits: `0p9o8i7u6y5t4r3e0p9o8i7u6y5t4r3`

and padding string at CBC mode is:
`drowssapdrowssap`
